Hey~Welcome to my blog.

I'm not a technical coder or programmer, so I plan to turn this blog into a weekly summary blog for recording what I obtained each week, including but not limited to the following topics:

* Summary of some interesting ~~and hopefully useful~~ papers I read this week.
* New ideas coming into my mind.
* Research progress.
* Recent news I'm interested in.
* ...

Hope I can persist on this meaningful thing. And many many thanks to my dear friend Yan who encouraged to establish this blog.
