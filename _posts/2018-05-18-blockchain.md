To be honest, I have no much passion or interest in blockchain. However, this word goes virus these days and I think nobody can avoid talking about it. In our group, Peter has so much passion on it and devotes much effort in this realm, such as participating a Venture competition held by the School of Business in GWU. Even though they didn't make it to the end, they established some interesting and reasonable framework, based on which we plan to  do some continuous work on it and make it a technical paper.

Therefore, I devote much time into the discussion on this paper, including the general framework and some detailed cryptography part. After the construction of the basic structure of this paper, I was assigned to undertake writing and formulation work on Searchable Encryption (SE), which involves much theoretical analysis. I think I can make it.

Besides, I help revise a paper related to finance/business, which spent me much time since I have little knowledge about this topic. However, I tried my best to accomplish it. Hope Dr. Wang find it is okay.

In the end, congratulations to the graduates 2018!
